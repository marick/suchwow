- Fix reflection warnings
- Bump libs

## [6.0.0] - 2016-10-26
- Upgrade to Specter 0.13
- ... which caused Clojure 1.6 to be abandoned, so major version bump.

## [5.2.4]
- Update dependencies.

## [5.2.3]
- Fixes bad `ns` form. @puredanger

## [5.2.1]

- ADD: Better error message when trying to immigrate a variable that does not exist.
- Update dependencies

- CHANGE: Guard against Clojure 1.9's `any?` - BÃ¸rge Svingen

## [5.1.3]
- CHANGE: Bump structural typing dependency

## [5.1.2]
- CHANGE: Update `structural-typing` because of annoying circular dependency.

## [5.1.1]
- CHANGE: Update versions, most notably `specter`, but also `environ`,
  `combinatorics`, `structural-typing`, and `compojure`.

## [5.1]
- ADD: such.imperfection has variants that print to *err* of these functions:
  `pr`, `prn`, `print`, `println`, `pprint`, `-pprint-`, `-prn-`, `tag-`, and `-tag`.

## [5.0]
- CHANGED: No longer support Clojure 1.5

## [4.4.3]
- DEPRECATION: In upcoming release, immigration functions will not `require` namespaces themselves.

## [4.4.2]

- bump versions of dependencies, including commons-codec

## [4.4.1]

- Use commons-codec 1.6 instead of 1.10. ring-codec uses 1.6. Since it's more popular,
  we might as well just track its preference to avoid shoving version conflicts into
  people's faces.

## [4.4.0]

### Added

- such.maps now supplies Clojure 1.7's `update` under Clojure 1.6.
- -tag and tag- can now take any value, not just a string.

### Added

- Functions in such.imperfection and such.readable can now be used with Clojure 1.6.

## [4.2.0]

### Added
- `such.metadata/contains?`

### Fixed
- All the `such.immigration` functions now do requires at compile time.
- Workaround to prevent Codox from crashing on vars imported with `import-prefixed-vars`.
