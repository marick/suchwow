   result would look like `<!cons!>`. 
   
   `f`'s name is found by these rules, checked in
   order:
   
   * `f` has had a name assigned with `rename`.
   
   * `f` is a key in `(deref anonymous-names)`. The value is its name. 
   
   * The function had a name assigned by `defn`, `let`, 
     or the seldom used \"named lambda\": `(fn name [...] ...)`.
     Note that multimethods do not have accessible names in current versions
     of Clojure. They are treated as anonymous functions.
   
   * The function is anonymous and there are no other anonymous names. The name is 
     `anonymous-name`, which is also stored in the `anonymous-names` atom.
   
   * After the first anonymous name, the names are `<anonymous-name>-2` `<anonymous-name>-3`
     and so on.

   In the single-argument version, the global or default elaborations are used,
   and `anonymous-names` is empty. See [[set-function-elaborations!]].
